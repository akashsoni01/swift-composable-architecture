          An "ifCaseLet" at "\(#fileID):\(#line - 5)" received a child action when child state was \
          set to a different case. …

            Action:
              Result.success(1)
            State:
              Result.failure(IfCaseLetReducerTests.SomeError())

          This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few reasons:

          • A parent reducer set "Result" to a different case before this reducer ran. This \
          reducer must run before any other reducer sets child state to a different case. This \
          ensures that child reducers can handle their actions while their state is still available.

          • An in-flight effect emitted this action when child state was unavailable. While it may \
          be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the associated effect \
          before child state changes to another case, especially if it is a long-living effect.

          • This action was sent to the store while state was another case. Make sure that actions \
          for this reducer can only be sent from a view store when state is set to the appropriate \
          case. In SwiftUI applications, use "SwitchStore".
